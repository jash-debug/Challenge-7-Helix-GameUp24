# Challenge-7-Helix-GameUp24

## Project Overview

Challenge-7-Helix-GameUp24 is a game development project aimed at polishing a basic helix-style game, enhancing its visual appeal, player retention, and interactivity. This project focuses on improving core gameplay mechanics, integrating visual assets like materials and textures, and adding new features such as Google Play Services integration and leaderboards to track player scores.

## Key Features:

- **Improved Game Retention**: Enhance gameplay experience to keep players engaged for longer periods.
- **Polished Visuals**: Use high-quality materials and textures to give the game a professional look.
- **Unity Colliders**: Practice using Unity's colliders to manage interactions and in-game physics.
- **Google Play Services Integration**: Seamlessly integrate Google Play Services, adding support for leaderboards and achievements.
- **Leaderboard Creator**: A custom leaderboard system to track and display player scores.

## Learning Objectives:

### Polishing a Basic Game:

- Learn how to take a simple game and elevate it with improved design elements and smoother gameplay.

### Improving Visuals:

- Apply materials and textures to objects in the game to enhance its aesthetics.
- Experiment with lighting, shaders, and visual effects to make the game more immersive.

### Unity Colliders:

- Practice implementing colliders to manage in-game interactions such as detecting when a player hits an obstacle or completes a level.
- Learn how colliders work in tandem with Unity’s physics engine for more dynamic gameplay elements.

### Leaderboard System:

- Implement a leaderboard using the LeaderboardCreator API to allow players to upload their high scores and compete globally.
- Display top scores on the leaderboard to motivate player engagement.

## Technologies Used:

- **Unity 3D**: Game development engine used to build the game.
- **LeaderboardCreator API**: Used for managing the leaderboard system.
